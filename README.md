# Decentralized Healthcare Data Management System

A blockchain-based platform for secure, transparent, and efficient management of healthcare data, enabling controlled access to patient records while maintaining privacy and regulatory compliance.

## Overview

This system leverages blockchain technology to create a secure and interoperable healthcare data management solution. It ensures patient data sovereignty while facilitating seamless sharing between authorized healthcare providers and enabling anonymous data sharing for research purposes.

## Core Smart Contracts

### Patient Record Contract

Manages individual patient health records with enterprise-grade encryption:
- Personal health information (PHI) storage and encryption
- Medical history tracking
- Treatment records management
- Lab results integration
- Imaging data references
- Audit trail maintenance

### Access Control Contract

Implements sophisticated permission management for healthcare data:
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Emergency access protocols
- Temporary access grants
- Provider credential verification
- Patient consent management
- Access revocation mechanisms

### Research Data Sharing Contract

Facilitates anonymous data sharing for medical research:
- Data anonymization protocols
- Aggregate data compilation
- Research purpose specification
- Usage tracking and analytics
- Compensation distribution
- Compliance verification

### Prescription Management Contract

Handles digital prescription lifecycle:
- Prescription creation and validation
- Refill tracking and automation
- Pharmacy integration
- Drug interaction checking
- Controlled substance monitoring
- Insurance verification

## Compliance & Security

### HIPAA Compliance
- End-to-end encryption
- Secure key management
- Access logging and monitoring
- Data retention policies
- Breach notification protocols

### Security Features
- Multi-factor authentication
- Zero-knowledge proofs
- Secure key rotation
- Hardware security module integration
- Regular security audits

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js v16.0 or higher
- Hardhat development environment

- IPFS node for decentralized storage
- SSL certificates for API endpoints

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/healthcare-blockchain.git
cd healthcare-blockchain
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Configure environment:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Add required security credentials and API keys
```

4. Deploy smart contracts:
```bash
npx hardhat deploy --network [network-name]
```

### Testing

Run comprehensive test suite:
```bash
npx hardhat test
```

Generate coverage report:
```bash
npx hardhat coverage
```

## System Architecture

### Data Layer
